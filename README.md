<h2>About the project</h2>
<p>
I'm utilizing the MERN stack for a personal project. Modern web apps are built using the popular JavaScript stack known as the MERN stack. It is made up of four primary technologies: the NoSQL database MongoDB; the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js; the online application framework Express.js for Node.js; and React, a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces.

A full-stack web application with a strong front end and an adaptable back end can be developed by the user by utilizing the MERN stack. Strong web application development is made easier with Express.js, while MongoDB offers a scalable and effective database solution. Node.js facilitates JavaScript server-side development, whereas React allows the development of dynamic and interactive user interfaces. </p>
